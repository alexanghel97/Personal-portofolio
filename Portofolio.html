          The most important thing I can say about myself is that I am an ambitious person and willing to learn new things and gain knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>The best way I can learn in my opinion is through teamwork and asking others for help when is needed.</p>

        <h3>Most important things about me !</h3>
        <p>First thing everyone should know about me is that I have a pretty charismatic person when I am comfortable with the people around me. Besides that I can also consider myself to be a very calm person and it's pretty hard to upset me , due to this fact I consider myself a person who works very well in a team.  </p>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">
          My aspirations as of right now :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1 - My main aspiration right now is to become a Frontend Developer :
            <br>
            Starting with the year 2023 I realized during my courses that the job of a Frontend Developer is eaxctly what would suit me . I hope that at the end of this course 
            I gained enough knowledge to be able to manage further within a company.
          </li>
          <li>
            2 - My second important aspiration is to buy myself a new car :
            <br>
            My main plan is that once I gained a well payed job and I am financially stable I can buy myself a new car . This is one of my dreams since I was young but I was never able to fulfill it , hopefully this will change soon enough.
          </li>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline;">My hobbies :</p>
          <li>
            1 - Gaming 
            <br>
            Most people are surprised when I tell them this but one of my biggest hobbies is gaming. I can say that I prefer gaming over watching a movie mainly because in my opinion the gaming industry has ended up writing much more captivating and complex stories than any movie I've seen lately.
          </li>
          <li>
            2 - Listening to music
            <br>
            I can say that listening to music is one of the few things that can trully calm my mind and make me focus on what needs to be done.
          </li>
          <li>
            3 - Swimming 
            <br>
            Swimming is another one of the activities that helps me relax and calm down and I consider it a perfect way to help pass the time. Unfortunately, there are not many people who are as eager to join me.
          </li>
          <li>
            4 - Driving 
            <br>
            I personally enjoy being behind the wheel and drive through the city at night preferably . Most of the people will tell you if they know me that I spend to much time inside the car.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">
          Things that I personally hate :
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 - Travelling
              <br>
              Another thing that surprises people is when I tell them that I hate to travel. In my personal own defense I can say that I tried many times to travel and enjoy it but was simply not possible . Everytime I travelled to a different place , especially in a foreign country I felt unconfortable.
            </li>
            <li>
              2 - Summer / Heat 
              <br>
              Most of the people are extremely happy when the summer season begins . I can say that I am not part of the majority of the people . I personally hate summer due to the ridiculous heat it reaches in some of the days. One of the factors that make me hate the summer is that my head also starts spinning around once it's too hot outside.
            </li>
          </ul>

                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>
                  When it comes to HTML I can say that so far I have a pretty good concept of how HTML is working and the way Elements, tags, attribures etc. could be used in order to have a better user experience.
                </p>
                <p>I can't say that I perfectly understand it , I can just say that as of right now is not hard for me to either use it or learn new things about it.</p>

              <div class="content">
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>
                  I personally find CSS to be a rather fascinating styling standard for web pages. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm still surprised by how many stylings there are provided by CSS , going from simple background colors to complex animations. 
                </p>
                <p>As for my experince with CSS, I don't have any problems using it or understanding it so far, my main issue seems to be that I don't have such a rich imagination so most probably if someone would ask me to style their webpage they will have to be very specific .</p>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                  When it comes to JavaScript I can say that I am familiar now and I have a good understanding of how the language is working. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I can't say that I fully understand it , and I still have a lot to learn about it . What can I say though is that much easier for me to use  and learn it than other  programming languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But I consider that I have a good knowledge of how JavaScript and what it can do.

                  I can most certainly describe myself as a person who is willing to learn new things and acquire new skills as long as I'm interested in the working domain. I belive that as long as the domain involves programming I have no problem of learning something new.

From a managing point of view I can't say that I have much experience. During my years of work I didn't really had the chance to be in charge of a proper team , I was more like a advisor to some of my colleagues.

                  This is a game where you have to guess a random number between 1 and 20.

                  The idea of the game is that the number you have to guess is hidden , and once you introduce a number in the console the game will automatically tell you if your number is either too high or too low .
